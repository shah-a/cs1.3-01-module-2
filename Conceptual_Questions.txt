Base: Optional

1. Using [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/), draw a **singly linked list** with three integer elements, `4`, `3`, and `9`. Be sure to indicate the head and tail. 


Link your drawing below:



2. Watch this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd1L64clh34, to review how to implement the following methods:
* append()
* remove()
* find()

Write what you learned below

Mastery: Required

1. Compare and contrast a linked list and a dynamic array for the prepend() method, what is the worst case time complexity for each?


Stretch: Optional

1. Implement a circular linked list and its methods and paste your solution here (bonus: also include worst-case time complexity analysis)

Here is one way to implement a circular linked list:(https://stonesoupprogramming.com/2017/05/21/circular-linked-list-python/) if you get stuck

Paste a link to your implementation below
